# parkingLot
I own a parking lot that can hold up to 'n' cars at any given point in time. Each slot is given a number starting at 1 increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in steps of one. I want to create an automated ticketing system that allows my customers to use my parking lot without human intervention.
